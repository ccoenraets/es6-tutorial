# 9. Using Promises

Promises have replaced callback functions as the preferred programming style for handling asynchronous calls. A promise is a holder for a result (or an error) that will become available in the future (when the async call returns). Promises have been available in JavaScript through third-party libraries (for example, [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/promise/) and [q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q)). ECMAScript 6 adds built-in support for promises to JavaScript. 
 
In this unit, you create a simple application called ratefinder that returns a list of available mortgage rates. 

## Part 1: Use a Promise

To illustrate the use of promises in this example, you use the new ```fetch()``` function. At the time of this writing, ```fetch()``` is available in the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Opera, but not in IE and Safari. You can check the current availability of `fetch()` [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch). You can read more about `fetch()` [here](http://jakearchibald.com/2015/thats-so-fetch/).

1. Create a file named `ratefinder.html` in the `es6-tutorial` directory. implemented the file as follows:

    ```
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    	<meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
    	<table id="rates"></table>
        <script src="build/ratefinder.bundle.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
 
1. Create a file named `ratefinder.js` in the `es6-tutorial/js` directory. implemented the file as follows:

    ```
    let url = "rates.json";
    
    fetch(url)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(rates => {
          let html = '';
          rates.forEach(rate => html += `<tr><td>${rate.name}</td><td>${rate.years}</td><td>${rate.rate}%</td></tr>`);
          document.getElementById("rates").innerHTML = html;
        })
        .catch(e => console.log(e));
    ```
    
    > To keep things simple, this code uses a static data file: rates.json. The application would work the same way with a URL pointing to a remote service.

1. Open `webpack.config.js` in your code editor. In `module.exports`, modify the entry and output items as follows:         

    ```
    entry: {
        app: './js/main.js',
        ratefinder: './js/ratefinder.js'
    },
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
        filename: '[name].bundle.js'
    },
    ```                

    > The **webpack** script will now compile two applications: **main.js** and **ratefinder.js**. It will create two compiled files based on the entry name: **app.bundle.js** and **ratefinder.bundle.js**.         
            
1. On the command line, type the following command to rebuild the application:

	```
    npm run webpack
	```

1. Open a browser, access [http://localhost:8080/ratefinder.html](http://localhost:8080/ratefinder.html).
          

## Part 2: Create a Promise

Most of the time, all you'll have to do is use promises returned by built-in or third-party APIs. Sometimes, you may have to create your own promises as well. In this section you create a mock data service to familiarize yourself with the process of creating ECMAScript 6 promises. The mock data service uses an asynchronous API so that it can replace an actual asynchronous data service for test or other purpose.

1. Create a new file named `rate-service-mock.js` in the `js` directory. 

1. In `rate-service-mock.js`, define a ```rates``` variable with some sample data:
 
    ```
    let rates = [
        {
            "name": "30 years fixed",
            "rate": "13",
            "years": "30"
        },
        {
            "name": "20 years fixed",
            "rate": "2.8",
            "years": "20"
        }
    ];
    ```
 
1. Define a ```findAll()``` function implemented as follows:

    ```
    export let findAll = () => new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (rates) {
            resolve(rates);
        } else {
            reject("No rates");
        }
    });
    ```
    
1. Open `ratefinder.js`. Change the implementation as follows:

    ```
    import * as service from './rate-service-mock';
    
    service.findAll()
        .then(rates => {
            let html = '';
            rates.forEach(rate => html += `<tr><td>${rate.name}</td><td>${rate.years}</td><td>${rate.rate}%</td></tr>`);
            document.getElementById("rates").innerHTML = html;
        })
        .catch(e => console.log(e));
    ```
    
1. On the command line, type the following command to rebuild the application:

	```
    npm run webpack
	```

1. Open a browser, access [http://localhost:8080/ratefinder.html](http://localhost:8080/ratefinder.html).
